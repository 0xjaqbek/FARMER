Create accountAssociation Credentials

The accountAssociation fields in the manifest are used to verify ownership of your app. You can generate these fields on Base Build.
Ensure all changes are live so that the Manifest file is available at your app’s url.
Navigate to the Base Build Account association tool.
Paste your domain in the App URL field (ex: sample-url.vercel.app) and click “Submit”
Click on the “Verify” button that appears and follow the instructions to generate the accountAssociation fields.
Copy the accountAssociation fields and paste them into the manifest file you added in the previous step.

Note: Because you are signing with your Base Account, the signature field will be significantly longer than if you were to sign directly with your Farcaster custody wallet.

Add Embed Metadata

Update your index.html file to include the fc:miniapp metadata. This is used to generate the rich embeds when your app is shared and is required for your app to display.
Vanilla JS
Next.js
Add directly to your index.html file.

Add your app URL to view the embeds and click the launch button to verify the app launches as expected.
Use the “Account association” tab to verify the association credentials were created correctly.
Use the “Metadata” to see the metadata added from the manifest and identify any missing fields.
9
Post to Publish

To publish your app, create a post in the Base app with your app’s URL.
